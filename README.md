## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

My job is to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.

## Overview

This app is nearly complete. It is only missing one thing… real data! While the views and controllers are defined in this application, it is missing models and model interactions to be able to store retrieve, and update data from a database. By the end of this project, I had a fully functioning site that is at least capable of doing the following, if not more, using a PostgreSQL database:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.



## Tech Stack (Dependencies)
Our tech stack will include the following:
 * **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
 * **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations
 * **HTML**, **CSS**, AND **JAVASCRIPT**  with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for website frontend

Overall:
* Models are located in the `MODELS` section of `app.py`.
* Controllers are also located in `app.py`.
* The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
* Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`


## Development Setup
1. **Download the project locally**
```
git clone https://github.com/reemkhd/Fyyur.git
cd Fyyur
```


2. **Install the dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. **Connect your local database:**
```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = '<your database>'
```


4. **Run the development server:**
```
export FLASK_APP=myapp
export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
python3 app.py
```


5. **Verify on the Browser**<br>
Navigate to project homepage [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
